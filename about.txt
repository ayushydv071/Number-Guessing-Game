This number guessing game in C++ is a great example of combining basic programming concepts into a fun and interactive console application. Here's a breakdown of the concepts used, functions involved.

🧠 Concepts Used in the Code
1. Header Files
- #include iostream For inputoutput operations.
- #include cstdlib For rand() and srand() functions.
- #include ctime For time(0) to seed the random number generator.
2. Namespace
- using namespace std; Allows use of standard library functions without prefixing std.
3. Random Number Generation
- srand(time(0)) Seeds the random number generator with the current time.
- rand() % 100 + 1 Generates a number between 1 and 100.
4. Variables and Data Types
- int secretNumber, guess, attempts Integer variables.
- bool hasWon Boolean flag to track win condition.
5. Control Structures
- while loop Runs until the user guesses correctly or exhausts 10 attempts.
- if-else statements Used to compare the guess with the secret number and give feedback.
6. InputOutput
- cin  guess Takes user input.
- cout  ... Displays messages to the user.
7. Logical Operators
- !hasWon && attempts  10 Combines conditions to control loop execution.
8. Game Logic
- Tracks number of attempts.
- Provides feedback based on guess.
- Ends game after 10 tries or successful guess.
