# Number-Guessing-Game
A simple number guessing game in C++
🎮 Game Overview
- The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- You get 10 chances to guess the number.
- After each guess, the game tells you if your guess is too high or too low.
- The game ends when:
- You guess correctly → You win!
- You use all 10 attempts → Game over

🛠️ Programming Concepts Used
- Basic Input/Output: cin and cout for user interaction.
- Random Number Generation: rand() and srand() with time(0) for seeding.
- Loops: for or while loop to manage attempts.
- Conditional Statements: if, else if, else to compare guesses.
- Simple Variables: int for storing guesses, attempts, and the target number.
- Comments: Clear inline comments to explain each step.

- Open terminal in the folder containing number_guessing_game.cpp.
- Compile using a C++ compiler:
